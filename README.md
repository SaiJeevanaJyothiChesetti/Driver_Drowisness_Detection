# Driver_Drowisness_Detection
This project is a Driver Drowsiness Detection System that uses a webcam and computer vision to monitor a driver's eyes in real-time. It detects drowsiness by checking if the eyes are closed for too long using *Haar Cascade classifiers. If drowsiness is detected, the system plays an alert sound to warn the driver.
